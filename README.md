# Fairness Toolkit

A comprehensive Python toolkit for evaluating machine learning model fairness across different demographic groups.

## Features

- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Generate comprehensive, self-contained HTML reports with embedded visualizations
- **Multiple Fairness Metrics**: Evaluate demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration parity, and disparate impact
- **Metric Selection**: See section below on choosing the appropriate fairness metrics with healthcare examples. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
from fairness_toolkit.reporting.interactive_fairness_report import generate_interactive_fairness_report

# Your model predictions
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0])
y_prob = np.array([0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.2, 0.9, 0.6, 0.7, 0.4])

# Sensitive features
sensitive_features = {
    'race': np.array(['White', 'Black', 'White', 'Black', 'White', 'Black', 'White', 'Black']),
    'sex': np.array(['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female'])
}

# Generate interactive report
report = generate_interactive_fairness_report(
    y_true=y_true,
    y_pred=y_pred,
    sensitive_features_dict=sensitive_features,
    y_prob=y_prob,
    output_path="fairness_report.html"
)

print(f"Report saved to: {report['output_path']}")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Privileged Groups

```python
# Define which groups to use as baseline for comparisons
privileged_groups = {
    'race': 'White',
    'sex': 'Male',
    'age': 'Middle'
}

report = generate_interactive_fairness_report(
    y_true=y_true,
    y_pred=y_pred,
    sensitive_features_dict=sensitive_features,
    y_prob=y_prob,
    privileged_groups=privileged_groups,
    output_path="custom_fairness_report.html"
)
```

### Individual Metrics

```python
from fairness_toolkit.metrics import calculate_all_metrics

# Calculate metrics for a single feature
metrics = calculate_all_metrics(y_true, y_pred, race_groups, y_prob)

print(f"Demographic parity: {metrics.demographic_parity}")
print(f"Equalized odds: {metrics.equalized_odds}")
print(f"Disparate impact: {metrics.disparate_impact}")
```

### Custom Visualizations

```python
from fairness_toolkit.visualization.fairness_plots import (
    plot_group_distributions,
    create_fairness_dashboard,
    plot_heatmap
)

# Create individual plots (returns base64 encoded images)
distributions_plot = plot_group_distributions(
    y_true, y_pred, race_groups, y_prob, feature_name='Race'
)

dashboard_plot = create_fairness_dashboard(
    y_true, y_pred, race_groups, y_prob, feature_name='Race'
)
```

## Report Features

The interactive HTML reports include:

### Overall Performance
- Model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC
- Prominently displayed for immediate assessment

### Feature Analysis
- Dropdown selector for different sensitive features
- Group-by-group performance metrics
- Visual comparisons across demographic groups

### Fairness Metrics
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates
- **Calibration Parity**: Equal predictive values across groups  
- **Disparate Impact**: 80% rule compliance testing

### Choosing the Right Fairness Metric

Selecting an appropriate fairness metric depends on your specific healthcare application and ethical priorities. Here's a decision flow to guide your choice:

**Start here:** What is your model predicting?
- **Resource allocation** (e.g., ICU bed assignment, organ transplant priority) → Consider **Demographic Parity** to ensure equal access rates across groups. This prevents systematic exclusion of certain populations from critical resources.
- **Risk prediction requiring accuracy** (e.g., disease diagnosis, mortality risk) → Consider **Equalized Odds** to maintain both equal true positive rates (sensitivity) and false positive rates across groups. This ensures no group systematically misses diagnoses or receives unnecessary interventions.
- **Probability-based decisions** (e.g., readmission risk scores, treatment response likelihood) → Consider **Calibration Parity** to ensure predicted probabilities mean the same thing across groups. A 70% risk should represent the same actual risk regardless of patient demographics.
- **Legal compliance or screening** (e.g., insurance eligibility, clinical trial enrollment) → Consider **Disparate Impact** (80% rule) as it aligns with legal standards and ensures selection rates don't disproportionately exclude protected groups.

**Additional considerations:**
- If false negatives are catastrophic (missing cancer diagnosis) → Consider prioritizing **Equalized Odds** with focus on TPR equality
- If false positives are harmful (unnecessary surgery recommendations) → Consider prioritizing **Equalized Odds** with focus on FPR equality
- If maintaining trust across communities is critical → Consider **Demographic Parity** to show equal treatment at face value
- If decisions involve thresholds or cutoffs → Consider **Calibration Parity** to ensure fair threshold application
